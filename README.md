# chnroutes-cfworker
Generate <abbr title="routes of mainland China">chnroutes</abbr> by fetching [RIR stats](https://www.apnic.net/about-apnic/corporate-documents/documents/resource-guidelines/rir-statistics-exchange-format/) and managing to compressing routes by merging consecutive CIDRs, deployed on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). 

## API
**Base URL: `https://chnroutes-worker.bamboo.workers.dev` [ðŸ”—](https://chnroutes-worker.bamboo.workers.dev)**

### Generate Routes
- **Endpoint: `/generate`**
- **Parameters:**
    - `countries`
        - Comma-separated list of countries represented by 2 letters [Country Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
        - A leading `!` indicates excluding. For example, `!CN` which indicats all countries/regions except mainland China in registries specified below. A single `!` indicates all countries. And so on...
    - `registries`
        - Comma-separated list of registries. 
        - Excluding is not supported.
        - RIR stats of all registry are fetched respectively when generating routes (regardless of caching). So be careful that it may take much longer to cover more registries.
- **Examples:**
    - `https://chnroutes-worker.bamboo.workers.dev/generate?countries=CN&registries=APNIC` [ðŸ”—](https://chnroutes-worker.bamboo.workers.dev/generate?countries=CN&registries=APNIC)
        - Typical chnroutes, useful for spliting traffic when bypassing the [GFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) with VPN/Proxies 
        - Becasuse almost all of mainland China IPs are delegated to APNIC currently (Sep 2019), so it might be sufficient to only cover APNIC.
